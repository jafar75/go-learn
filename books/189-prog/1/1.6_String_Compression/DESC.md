# String Compression

Given a string, remove repeated consecutive characters and just put their count after the first char.

For instance, aabcccccaaa -> a2b1c5a3

If length of the compressed string equals to original string, just return the original. e.g.  abbccc -> a1b2c3 (len = 6) so return abbccc
