# Is Unique

Given a string as input, decide if all characters of the string are unique or not.

I decided to use a [bitset](https://github.com/bits-and-blooms/bitset) as a third-party. It is obvious that the question can be easily solved by standard features of Go, but my main target was to learn how to include a library in a Go project.
